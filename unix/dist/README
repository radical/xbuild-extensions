Dist targets:

Tries to provide functionality similar to 'make dist'.

$(DistDir) specifies the dir where to copy the files.

$(TargetExtensionsDir) specifies the extensions dir where to
install these targets.

By default, it will collect all the @(Compile), @(EmbeddedResource),
@(Content) and @(None) item lists. If there are other files that
should be included in the dist, then those can be specified in
the @(ExtraDist) item list. eg:

 <ItemGroup>
	<ExtraDist Include="images\one.gif"/>
	<ExtraDist Include="images\two.gif"/>
 </ItemGroup>
